### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: The Variation of Lyric Length Among Genre, Year, and Artist
+ This project is conducted by [Tiantian Chu]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] The length of lyrics--often referred as the number of words per sentence, can shows many things. We  might all have the following experience: a line of a fast-rhythm song like, such as a Hip-pop, would only contain less than 5 words while that of a folk or countrystyle song would have more than 10 words per sentence. Also, the old songs seem to be more "wordy" in contrast to rhythmic contemporary songs. In this project, we will explore the lyrics dataset about the linkage of lyric length to factors like genre and year.
